Source: Whey protein is derived from milk during the cheese-making process. Milk contains two main types of protein: casein (about 80%) and whey (about 20%). Whey is the liquid portion that separates from the curds.

Forms: Common forms include:

Whey Protein Concentrate (WPC): Contains ~70-80% protein and some lactose/fat.

Whey Protein Isolate (WPI): Contains ~90%+ protein with minimal lactose and fat.

Whey Protein Hydrolysate (WPH): Predigested for faster absorption, often used in medical supplements or sports formulas.

Benefits:

Supports muscle growth and repair (rich in branched-chain amino acids like leucine).

Helps meet daily protein intake, especially for athletes or people with higher protein needs.

May assist in weight management by promoting satiety.

Usage: Typically 20–30g per serving, post-workout or as a dietary supplement to meet protein requirements.

Precautions: Generally safe for healthy individuals. People with lactose intolerance may prefer isolates or lactose-free formulas.
